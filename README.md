## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

I’m **Irudunoghena Osiseh Peace**, a **Business Intelligence & Data Analyst** who believes data should do more than sit in dashboards.  

To me, data is a language. It should **tell stories, uncover hidden problems, reveal opportunities, and guide smarter business decisions.**  

With expertise in **Power BI, Excel, SQL, and Python**, I transform raw and messy datasets into **clear, actionable insights**. My mission is simple:  

**To BRIDGE the GAP between DATA and BUSINESS by making complex findings UNDERSTANDABLE, IMPACTFUL AND DECISION-READY.**

💡 My philosophy:  
*Dashboards give you the **what**. I help you uncover the **why.***

## 🚀 My Journey

I started my career exploring **Machine Learning & AI projects**, from building spam classifiers to language translators. But along the way, I realized something powerful:  
> **Business leaders don’t just need predictions. They need clarity.**  

That realization pushed me to focus on **analytics and business intelligence**. Now, my daily work revolves around:  

- Cleaning and preparing messy data  
- Designing dashboards that go beyond visuals to answer *real business questions*  
- Writing SQL queries and Python scripts to dig deeper into hidden insights  
- Using Power BI and Excel to track KPIs, automate reporting, and forecast performance  
- Communicating insights in a way that sparks **action, not just observation**
